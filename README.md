# Firebase Transaction Race Condition
This repository demonstrates a potential race condition in Firebase Realtime Database transactions, specifically when dealing with concurrent updates of a counter.  Multiple clients attempting to increment the counter simultaneously can lead to data inconsistency. The solution explores techniques to mitigate this problem, focusing on server-side logic and concurrency control.

## Problem
The core issue stems from the optimistic nature of Firebase transactions.  If multiple clients initiate a transaction on the same data, they might read the same stale value, leading to incorrect final values. 

## Solution
To ensure data consistency, the solution implements atomic counter updates using Firebase's transaction functionality while addressing potential concurrency issues.  The improved version utilizes proper error handling and ensures that only one client successfully updates the counter in any given moment.
