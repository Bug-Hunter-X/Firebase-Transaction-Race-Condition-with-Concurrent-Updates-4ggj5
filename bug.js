The following code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in Firebase when using transactions with concurrent updates.  It involves a race condition that can lead to unexpected data loss or inconsistency. 

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('counter').transaction(function(currentCount) {
  if (currentCount === null) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return currentCount + 1;
  }
});
```
This might fail if multiple clients increment the counter concurrently, each reading the same old value before any of the updates are committed to the server.
